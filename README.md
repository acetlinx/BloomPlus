Relax, Exercise, and Schedule Your Way Out of Stress

## Inspiration
The coronavirus pandemic has affected everyone in some shape or form, whether it be through the loss of a loved one, being laid off, or rather simply the change of social norms that have mental/social implications. As students attending universities across the United States, we've often felt unmotivated to accomplish any of our academic studies, perform physical activity to maintain our health, or being socially active to keep our personalities engaged. We wanted to develop an application that could target physical, mental, and social health holistically - keeping student healthy through an organized approach.

## What it does
Upon logging in, the user is greeted with statistics and what needs to be accomplished throughout the rest of the day. The tabs on the bottom of the user interface navigate throughout the app and attempts to conquer different aspects regarding the user's health. The education section keeps track of the user's academic studies by listing their homework, important deadlines, and their exam dates. The user can add to this agenda by adding it through the application. The diet section of the application keeps track of what the user is going to be eating and drinking throughout the day, and the user can make adjustments via removal and addition. This will allow users to keep track of their caloric intake. The fitness section of the application keeps track of what physical activity the user should pursue in their respective day and provides a link to their respective workout on YouTube, encouraging them to connect with people online to facilitate the activity. The final section is the mental health section where users can listen to white noise and podcasts, hopefully putting their mind at ease and potentially gain insight in the process.

## How We built it
We utilized Figma to remove the aspect of coding from the user interface design process. This ensures that our creativity has room to flourish on a fresh canvas. We downloaded Flutter, a UI toolkit provided by Google, and used Dart, a client-optimized programming language, to develop the user interface of the application from the Figma in a rather short amount of time that'll work on both the IOS and Android devices. We continued to use Flutter and Dart to create the respective functions of the applications for each section. We implemented a Firebase database (from Google) to store the applications data, such as username, password, and their agenda for the week.

## Challenges we ran into
Communication between the team members was a key issue that hindered our ability to finish this application in a 36 hour time frame. On top of that, there were issues with connecting the Flutter application to the Firebase database in order to actually store the user's data. Often, it would either not run the application at all or wouldn't recognize the existence of the database within our code.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to finish the basic functionality of the application, despite problems with the database. Some of us fortunately took this hackathon and this application as an opportunity to learn React, Flutter, Dart, and connecting information to Firebase databases.

## What we learned
The more important thing we learned was that collaboration and cooperation is the key to success in project oriented activities, especially in a virtual hackathon that requires its respective hackers to develop an application in a span of 36 hours. Collaboration and cooperation enables the team to not only get certain aspects of the project done in a reasonable amount of time, but also the end product will tackle issues often overlooked when working independently.

## What's next for Bloom+
We want to utilize this application that we submitted to the hackathon as the foundation of an organization application for high school or college students with more advanced functionality built upon it. These advanced functionalities include more social networking through Zoom/phone calls directly from the app (Ex. Virtual Workout Buddies), keeping track of the calories without the user having the put the amount of calories directly into the application, and an implementation that allows students to automatically get virtual information from YouTube or other websites regarding the current academic topics they're studying. All in all, this idea/application has both creativity and infinite room to prosper and it comes down to whether or not we make the commitment to pursue this.

## Compatibility
